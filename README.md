# <span style="color: #4CAF50;">NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT</span>

<span style="color: #555555;">This project uses a BERT-based model to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to games. The goal is to classify sentiments into three categories: <strong>Negative</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Positive</strong>. The model is trained on a custom dataset containing tweets, with preprocessing, tokenization, and classification steps implemented.</span>

## Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets related to games into **Negative**, **Neutral**, or **Positive** sentiments using the BERT transformer model. The workflow includes dataset loading, text preprocessing, tokenization, model training, and prediction, with results saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
